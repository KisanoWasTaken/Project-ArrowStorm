                    <p>This site is a site created by a guy and is dedicated to DDR and ITG style rhythm games! It aims to create a place where people can hang out, create beatcharts/maps (elimanate as applicable, but we do arrows and mania here.) and share them with the world!</p>
                    <li><h4>Is there a team behind this?</h4></li>
                    <p>Nope! This is a one man rodeo! Some help would be nice though...</p>
                    <li><h4><strong>Will this site ever be finished...?</strong></h4></li>
                    <p><i>Let's...Let's not answer that question so early...I'm not sure yet, but I'm determined to finish it. No matter what.</i></p>
