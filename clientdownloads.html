                    <h4>Stepmania</h4>
                    <p>Stepmania is the original out of most of the clients on the internet, being what some of the most popular are mainly based off. As of the time of writing, however, development has significantly stagnated since 5.1</p>

                    <p>Project Outfox is a fork of Stepmania created by some parts of the original team. It is currently closed source. Be warned that this client is HIGHLY unstable. BE CAREFUL!</p>

                    <h4>ITGMania</h4>
                    <p>ITGMania is a fork of Stepmania that is more focused on the ITG community. I don't have much info on this so far except for the fact that it's supposed to be a GSLauncher replacement.</p>
                    <!--- I have NEVER dealt with SVG before, so it might be a while before I can get this working. Sorry! UPDATE: Working now. --->

                    <h4>NotITG</h4>
                    <p>NotITG is a closed source fork of OpenITG (based off Stepmania) that has more of a focus on generating modcharts and focuses more on artistic freedom. It's also what inspired me to make this site (because *cough* *cough* SOME PEOPLE just can't let good tutorials last more than a year... *cough* *hackle* *cough*)</p>
                    <!---SMOKES, THATS HUGE. The transparent logo will be a problem. Update: to save you some hair, if you want to change the colour of a button, go for it's background.--->
