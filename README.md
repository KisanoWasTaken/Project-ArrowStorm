# **Project ArrowStorm**

Project ArrowStorm is a passion driven 2000s style love letter project that aims to create a hub for the Stepmania and ITG communities! It's also aims to solve a few problems between them.

## So, what's this about?

Well, glad you asked! ArrowStorm aims to create a place where it's easy to learn how to create charts, share them and download them! It's also adding a forums section and a themes section (both may not make it into this repo, due to requiring external servers, but who knows?)!

## Where's the dev log?

## Can I help with anything?

Feel free to! I'm operating on a basis of pull and commit, to prevent any unwanted changes, so be warned of that. If there's anything you want to implement, check the GOALS.txt file to see what is currently needed. If it's there, make an issue first and if it's not marked as resolved within 7 days, that's your go ahead! If what you want to add isn't in GOALS.txt, hit me up at <kisanosano@proton.me>.
